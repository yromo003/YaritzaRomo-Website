        <p class="lead mb-4">Currently, I work on-campus in the Glasgow Dining Hall, where I serve meals to students, staff, and faculty members. My position in the dining hall has provided me with valuable experience in customer service, communication, and teamwork. These skills are transferable to the healthcare field and will undoubtedly serve me well as a PA.Despite my busy schedule, I remain committed to pursuing my dream of becoming a PA. I plan to apply to PA programs in the coming year and am excited to learn from experienced healthcare professionals. 
<br><br>

        My ultimate goal is to provide compassionate and comprehensive care to patients and work towards reducing healthcare disparities, particularly for underserved communities. My interest in healthcare equity is rooted in my own experiences. As a first-generation college student and daughter of immigrants, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by underrepresented communities. I am fluent in Spanish and understand the importance of culturally competent care in providing quality healthcare services to immigrant and refugee communities.In addition to my academic and professional experiences, I am also involved in extracurricular activities on campus. I am a member of the Student Health Advisory Committee, where I provide input on student health services and programs. I am also a volunteer mentor for the Undergraduate Research Mentorship Program, where I help mentor underrepresented students in conducting research projects.I am committed to using my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in the world.
<br><br>

         As a future PA, I hope to work in a community health center or another setting that serves underserved populations. I plan to use my bilingual skills, phlebotomy certification, and customer service experience to provide compassionate and culturally competent care to patients.I am also interested in research and advocacy, particularly in the areas of healthcare equity and access to care. I believe that research can help identify the root causes of health disparities and inform policies that address these issues. I am also interested in advocating for policies that promote healthcare equity and access to care for all. Looking to the future, I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for me as I grow with my profession. I am also particularly interested in the fields of dermatology, and hope to one day work in an international setting to provide medical care to underserved populations.  Overall, I am a driven and dedicated individual with a strong passion for healthcare and social justice. My experiences, skills, and academic achievements have prepared me well for the challenges of pursuing a career as a physician assistant. I am excited to continue on this journey and am eager to make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients and in the broader healthcare system.
